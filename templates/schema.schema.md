# Schema Schema

## Role

Schema documents define how object templates should be written and interpreted.

## Relationships

- `schema.md` is the reusable template for schema documents.
- Object-specific schema files describe the fields and body sections of their related templates.
- Protocols may reference schema-defined fields when describing state transitions.

- Use for schema documents that need creation traceability.

Applicability:

- Use on schema documents tied to a specific template.

Format:

- Relative link to the related template file.

### status (optional)

Meaning:

- Lifecycle state of the schema document.

Applicability:

- Use when the schema itself needs to track review or maturity.

Allowed values:

- `Draft`
- `Stable`
- `Deprecated`

### owner (optional)

Meaning:

- Human or AI responsible for maintaining the schema.

## Conventions

- Keep the schema specific to the related template.
- Do not treat this file as inherited defaults for every object.
- `created`, `related_template`, `status`, and `owner` are common schema-document fields, not automatic object fields.

## Notes

- Schema documents are templates for writing schema documents.
